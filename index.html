            <h2>Open Source Freedom</h2>
            <p>Linux is open-source, meaning the code is freely available to everyone. This transparency ensures that you can inspect, modify, and distribute the code as you see fit. With Linux, you’re not just a user; you're part of a community that builds, shares, and improves the software collectively.</p>
            <p>Open source empowers you to make the system your own. Want to add a feature? You can contribute to the code yourself or find a like-minded developer who has already created it. The flexibility is unparalleled.</p>
